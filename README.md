# LinkedIn-Post-Generator-using-LLM
A Python-based project to generate LinkedIn posts in the style of an influencer using LLMs and Python Programming and implementing prompt engineering and few-shot learning .

The workflow involves:

Data Extraction & Processing:
Collected raw data from an influencer's LinkedIn posts.
Processed the data into JSON format.
Used LLM (Llama model) to extract tags and line counts, creating a structured dataset.

Interactive Interface:
Built a Streamlit-based interface to display extracted tags and post lengths.
Enabled user interaction for selecting tags and post lengths.

Post Generation:
Fetched user-selected data from the processed file.
Utilized few-shot learning and prompt engineering to generate posts in the influencerâ€™s style.

Key Technologies Used:
Python Libraries: LangChain, Streamlit, Pandas
Programming Concepts: Modular Programming, OOP
ML Techniques: Prompt Engineering, Few-shot Learning
